Aruba Switches Backup Tool

Overview :
This Python script automates the creation of a structured backup directory system. Itâ€™s designed to organize and store backups for multiple buildings and floors, each categorized by date. The tool is particularly useful for network engineers and IT professionals who need a systematic way to manage and store configuration backups from multiple network devices.

Features :
Automated Folder Creation: The script creates a top-level backup directory named with the current date.
Hierarchical Structure: Inside the dated backup folder, subfolders are created for each building, and within those, additional subfolders for each floor.
Customizable: Easily adjust the building names, floor names, and base directory according to your specific environment.


Requirements:
Python 3.x
TFTP Server such as "solar winds TFTP server"
Compatible with Windows operating systems


Usage :

Clone the Repository: Download the script to your local machine.

Customize this code with your switch details
{"hostname": "switch ip ", "username": "switch username", "password": "switch password", "building": "building name", "floor": "DataCenter"},
 
then # Add more switches as needed

 #add your device ip after "tftp"
        shell.send(f'copy st tftp your ip {backup_filename}\n')


Run the Script: Execute the Python script to generate the backup folder structure:
open cmd 
navigate to the file path : cd path/to/your/project
Copy code : python aruba-switches-backup-tool.py
Find Your Backups: The script will generate a folder named Backup_<YYYYMMDD> inside your specified directory (e.g., D:\backups). Inside this folder, you will find subdirectories for each building and floor.
